# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** JSON-driven browser automation — zero Python per new workflow
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.0 complete — all 7 phases delivered

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 7 (Support skip-if-not-visible) — Complete
Status: All plans complete
Last activity: 2026-05-26 -- Phase 7 complete (SkipElementSignal + factory guard + engine catch)

Progress: [██████████████░] 86%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 1: Used `resolve_refs(data, base_dir)` recursive approach with a `set`-based circular reference guard
- Phase 1: Kept `$ref` as full-replacement (no sibling key merging) for simplicity
- Phase 5: D-01: Reused existing `WaitConditionDefinition.timeout` field as sleep duration for WAIT_SECONDS — no schema change needed
- Phase 5: D-02: Added `WAIT_SECONDS = "wait_seconds"` as the last value in `WaitConditionType` enum
- Phase 5: D-03: Implemented sleep via isolated `_sleep_seconds()` helper on WaitManager with WARNING log and code comment per CLAUDE.md

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 1 added: Support Nested JSON ($ref resolution)
- Phase 2 added: Support checkBox, radio, number, email web elements in element_actions.py
- Phase 3 added: Support switching tab, then focusing on it in new window of chrome browser as workflow JSON definition
- Phase 4 added: Support dynamic placeholder expansion — registry-based ${placeholder} resolution in workflow JSON values
- Phase 5 added: Support wait_seconds — fixed-duration pause in pre_wait/post_wait via WaitConditionType.WAIT_SECONDS
- Phase 6 added: Support execute_js_script — execute arbitrary JS via element.value; SCRIPT added to ElementType
- Phase 7 added: Support skip_if_not_visible — SkipElementSignal exception + ActionFactory visibility probe + WorkflowEngine catch; optional elements skip cleanly without FAILED status

### Phase 6 Decisions

- D-01: Add `SCRIPT = "script"` to `ElementType` enum (dedicated type, avoids reusing BUTTON like window-switch)
- D-02: Add `EXECUTE_JS_SCRIPT = "execute_js_script"` to `ActionType` enum
- D-03: Dispatch via `driver.execute_script(str(value))` — value-only, no element binding, return value silently ignored
- Locator remains required on ElementDefinition (no model change); dummy locator acceptable in JSON
