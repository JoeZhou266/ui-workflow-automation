# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** JSON-driven browser automation — zero Python per new workflow
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — support-env-placeholder

## Current Position

Phase: 10 (support-env-placeholder) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 1
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-05-30

Progress: [███████████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 1: Used `resolve_refs(data, base_dir)` recursive approach with a `set`-based circular reference guard
- Phase 1: Kept `$ref` as full-replacement (no sibling key merging) for simplicity
- Phase 5: D-01: Reused existing `WaitConditionDefinition.timeout` field as sleep duration for WAIT_SECONDS — no schema change needed
- Phase 5: D-02: Added `WAIT_SECONDS = "wait_seconds"` as the last value in `WaitConditionType` enum
- Phase 5: D-03: Implemented sleep via isolated `_sleep_seconds()` helper on WaitManager with WARNING log and code comment per CLAUDE.md
- [Phase ?]: D-10-01: env: namespace prefix routes to _ENV_CONFIG dict before PLACEHOLDER_REGISTRY; configure_env_resolver wired in AppConfig.__init__ after _load_yaml()

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 1 added: Support Nested JSON ($ref resolution)
- Phase 2 added: Support checkBox, radio, number, email web elements in element_actions.py
- Phase 3 added: Support switching tab, then focusing on it in new window of chrome browser as workflow JSON definition
- Phase 4 added: Support dynamic placeholder expansion — registry-based ${placeholder} resolution in workflow JSON values
- Phase 5 added: Support wait_seconds — fixed-duration pause in pre_wait/post_wait via WaitConditionType.WAIT_SECONDS
- Phase 6 added: Support execute_js_script — execute arbitrary JS via element.value; SCRIPT added to ElementType
- Phase 7 added: Support skip_if_not_visible — SkipElementSignal exception + ActionFactory visibility probe + WorkflowEngine catch; optional elements skip cleanly without FAILED status
- Phase 8 added: Support checkbox search by name+value — transparent enhancement to CHECK/UNCHECK via CSS selector (mirrors select_radio pattern)
- Phase 9 added: Support last-day-of-month placeholder — `${last_day_of_month}` generator returning MM/DD/YYYY of last calendar day of current month

### Phase 6 Decisions

- D-01: Add `SCRIPT = "script"` to `ElementType` enum (dedicated type, avoids reusing BUTTON like window-switch)
- D-02: Add `EXECUTE_JS_SCRIPT = "execute_js_script"` to `ActionType` enum
- D-03: Dispatch via `driver.execute_script(str(value))` — value-only, no element binding, return value silently ignored
- Locator remains required on ElementDefinition (no model change); dummy locator acceptable in JSON
